## Git Project Tasks

### Prerequisites

* A Git client
* A remote Git repository

### Steps

1. Create a directory for your Git repository:

Use code with caution. Learn more
mkdir my-git-repo


2. Navigate to the directory you just created:

cd my-git-repo


3. Initialize a new Git repository:

git init


4. Create the `master` branch:

git checkout master


5. Create the `public1`, `public2`, and `private` branches:

git checkout -b public1
git checkout -b public2
git checkout -b private


6. Create the `master.txt` file on the `master` branch:

git checkout master
touch master.txt


7. Add the `master.txt` file to the staging area:

git add master.txt


8. Commit the changes to the `master` branch:

git commit -m "Added master.txt file"


9. Create the `public1.txt` file on the `public1` branch:

git checkout public1
touch public1.txt


10. Add the `public1.txt` file to the staging area:

git add public1.txt


11. Commit the changes to the `public1` branch:

git commit -m "Added public1.txt file"


12. Merge the `public1` branch into the `master` branch:

git checkout master
git merge public1


13. Merge the `public2` branch into the `master` branch:

git checkout master
git merge public2


14. Edit the `master.txt` file on the `private` branch:

git checkout private
vim master.txt


15. Stage the changes on the `private` branch:

git add master.txt


16. Commit the changes on the `private` branch:

git commit -m "Edited master.txt file"


17. Rebase the `public1` branch on the `master` branch:

git checkout public1
git rebase master


18. Push the changes to the `public1` branch to the remote repository:

git push origin public1

Repeat steps 17-18 to rebase the public2 branch on the master branch and push it to the remote repository.
Tips
When merging branches, it is important to resolve any conflicts that may occur.
When rebasing a branch, it is important to force push the changes to the remote repository so that other developers can see them.
It is also a good practice to create pull requests before merging your changes into the master branch. This will allow other developers to review your changes and provide feedback.# Git-Assignment-4
